There are multiple datasets in KGC task, we list the standard ones as:

## Neighbot-Enhanced KBE papers
1. **WN18.**
    > WN18 is a KGC dataset built upon wordnet. As it contain muliple inverse relations, there exist ovelap between train/dev/test.
    
1. **FB15K.**
    > FB15K is a KGC dataset built upon Freebase. As it contain muliple inverse relations, there exist ovelap between train/dev/test.
    
1. **WN18RR.**
    > A subset of WN18, which don't contain any inverse relations.
    
1. **FB15K-237.**
    > A subset of FB15K, which don't contain any inverse relations.
    
1. **YAGO3-10.**
    > YAGO3-10 is a KGC dataset built upon YAGO.
